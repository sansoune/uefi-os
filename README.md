# My Custom OS
Welcome to My Custom OS - an open source UEFI operating system written from scratch in C. This OS is my attempt to learn low-level system programming by following the excellent video tutorial series by Poncho.

While still in the early stages of development, I have made significant progress:

## About My OS
I started this project to teach myself kernel development and OS internals step-by-step from the ground up. Throughout the journey of building this OS, I've learned:

- Implementing a custom bootloader to set up a UEFI environment.
- Writing kernel initialization in pure assembly and transitioning to C.
- Developing core OS services like heap allocation and memory management.
- Implementing PS/2 keyboard and text console drivers.
- Adding rudimentary AHCI and PCIe drivers for disk access.
- Creating a simple shell with basic commands.
While still a work in progress, I'm proud of the foundation I've built so far. This OS has come a long way from a blank screen to running multiple processes with hardware access. I'm hoping experienced systems programmers may find some educational value in my code.
